We use geometric transformations to modify the spatial arrangement of pixels in an image.
Since they are applied to every pixel in the image—or point in 2D for a grayscale image—these changes are known as point transformations. They are linear since matrix multiplications (and additions) can be used to do the transformation.

There are four classes of linear transfomations as follows:
1.Euclidean transformation/isometry
2.Similarity transformation
3.Affine transformation
4.Homography transformation

The Euclidean is a special case of the affine:- see fig2.1

.Geometric transformations of digital images consist of two basic operations: 
	1. Spatial transformation of coordinates. 
	2. Intensity interpolation that assigns intensity values to the spatially transformed 
	   pixels.
